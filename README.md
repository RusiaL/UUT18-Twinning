# Project Overview
This project explores how digital healthcare tools such as mHealth and telehealth can support access to medical services in Ukraine during and after the conflict. With traditional healthcare infrastructure and personnel severely strained, digital solutions offer a low-resource, cost-effective way to improve outreach, reduce healthcare expenses, and strengthen the country’s resilience and recovery.

## Data
The project uses two datasets based on a survey examining participants’ experience with eHealth services in Ukraine.
- `Questionnair.xlsx`            
Contains the raw survey data with 208 records and 23 features, capturing respondents’ usage patterns, attitudes, and experience with digital healthcare tools.
- `Questionnair2.xlsx`                
Includes the preprocessed version of the same dataset, with cleaned and transformed data used for analysis in the accompanying notebooks.

## Notebooks
- `survey.ipynb`                
Provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of the survey dataset, including general patterns, distributions, and initial insights.
- `survey2.ipynb`              
Focuses on analysing responses specifically from participants who have used eHealth services, offering a deeper look into their experiences and perceptions.
